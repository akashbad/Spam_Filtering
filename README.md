Spam Filtering 
=========================

This is a python project that implements [Paul Graham's Spam Filtering Algorithm](http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html).

The training and testing data is included in these folders, with non-spam in the "ham" folders and spam in the "spam" folders.

This project was created for an interview with [filepicker.io](http://filepicker.io).
